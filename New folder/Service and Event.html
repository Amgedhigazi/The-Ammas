          <P><h4>Catering services should leave nothing to be desired. If the visitors feel comfortable with you, your trade fair appearance will also be fondly remembered.h4></P>

          <p>You will not receive a standard program from us, but perfect support for your presence. Everything is freshly and individually prepared in our house, so we have our own production. You decide how far we support you with trade fair catering, full or reliable partial service. Every year we accompany many customers to the Leipzig trade fair to their complete satisfaction - this is where we are at home, this is where we know our way around. We are at your side with advice and action.</P>
          <h4>Popular classics</h4>
        
            <P>From hearty snacks, delicate finger food to cold and warm delicacies to drinks, we create selected delicacies for your presentation, stand party or simply to entertain your guests and employees.</P>

              <P><h4>It's about business. Follow the brief guidelines below and you will find yourself moving with confidence from one excellent business opportunity to the next at your next business event.</h4></p>
              <P>Hold your drink or food in your left hand.
                Your right hand must be clean, dry and available for shaking hands.
                There is no gracious way to juggle cocktail party food.
                The foods served at these events are called hors d’oeuvres or canapés. They are small snacks such as cheese, meat, or vegetables.  They may be served on a cracker, a miniature piece of toast, or on a  little piece of bread.
                Hors d’oeuvres may be eaten with fingers or a utensil.
                Hors d’oeuvres may be presented on a plate, or you may be given a paper cocktail napkin when you are served.
                If this is a business event and there is a photographer wandering around taking pictures, you may not want to be snapped holding an alcoholic beverage.
                
                Follow these simple guidelines and you will always appear well-schooled and competent in business and social manners.</P>
